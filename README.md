	branches in Git


SCM tools
 
For Source-Code Management (SCM), version control tools such as Git, GitHub, 
Subversion, TFS, and Mercurial are used.

Source code management (SCM) is where the development teams share and collaborate. 
among themselves.

Source Code Management: Tools
Some of the preferred tools for Source Code Management are

 
What Is Git?

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It is 
generally used for source code management in software development.

 

What Is GitHub?

GitHub provides web-based git repository hosting service which provides web 
interface to upload files. 

 

What Is Bitbucket?

Bitbucket is the Git repository management solution designed for professional teams. It 
provides a central place for managing git repositories, collaborate on source code, and guide 
the development process.

What Is GitLab?
GitLab is a service that provides remote access to Git repositories.

repository
Create a repository git init 
Check the repository Create a working copy of 
a local repository
git clone /path/to/repository 
Check the repository Use a remote server git clone username@host:/path/to/repositor
 
 
 

 

 
 

 


 

 


Introduction to Branches

 A Git branch is a lightweight movable pointer to the commits. It is a separate workspace, usually created when you need to experiment or test something, without impacting the main code base.

 




 


 

 

 


 

 


Key Takeaways

	Software configuration management (SCM) is a set of processes, policies, and tools that organizes the development process.
	Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. GitHub provides web-based git repository hosting service which provides web interface to upload files.
	The different operations of branching are creating a branch, merging a branch, delete a branch, and checkout a branch.
